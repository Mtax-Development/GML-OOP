This constructor manages that value through its set() and modify() methods. With them, the value is set to its equivalent in the 360° range, where 0 and 360 are treated as the same number, with 0 being prioritized. This improves the readability of the value, as it otherwise can be hard to recognize when the value operates on high numbers, especially if it was continously modified.",
