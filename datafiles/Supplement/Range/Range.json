Usually, the minimum number is expected to be lower than the maximum number, and they are not meant equal each other, as using a single number instead of a constructor is sufficient. The boundary created by two numbers of the range is inclusive, meaning numbers equal to either of them are treated as being within that range, unless it is possible to specify otherwise.",
