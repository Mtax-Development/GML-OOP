Please visit the project [Wiki](https://github.com/Mtax-Development/GML-OOP/wiki) for more information and examples.

# Initialization
This project can be imported into other GameMaker projects either from a prepared release or by creating an importable package from the latest code in the [master](https://github.com/Mtax-Development/GML-OOP/tree/master) branch. Using an available release is recommended, as this branch can contain unfinished code that is not ready for a release.

### Importing a release
1. Head to the [Releases](https://github.com/Mtax-Development/GML-OOP/releases) tab and download a release in the `.yymps` file.
2. Open a project in GameMaker into which the release will be included.
3. In the `Tools` toolbar, open the `Import Local Package` menu.
4. Choose the previously downloaded release file and open it.
5. Select `Add All` and then `Import`. The release should now be imported and appear in the `Asset Browser`, unless files with the same name have already existed in the project, in which case they can be replaced or skipped.
6. Confirm that each individual file was imported successfully.
