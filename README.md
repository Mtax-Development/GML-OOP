# About

**GameMaker Language Object Overlay Project** is a library created in GameMaker Language for operating the primary functionalities of GameMaker Studio 2 through a set of constructors.

Please visit the project [Wiki](https://github.com/Mtax-Development/GML-OOP/wiki) for more information and examples.


# Initialization

The project can be importing into other GameMaker Studio 2 projects either from a prepared release or by creating an importable package from the latest code of the [master](https://github.com/Mtax-Development/GML-OOP/tree/master) branch. Using an available release is recommended, as this branch can contain unfinished code not ready for a release.

### Importing a Release

1. Head to the [Releases](https://github.com/Mtax-Development/GML-OOP/releases) tab and download a release in an `.yymps` file.
2. Open a project in GameMaker Studio 2 to which the release is to be included into.
3. In the `Tools` toolbar, open the `Import Local Package` menu.
4. Choose the downloaded release file and open it.
5. Choose `Add All` and then `Import`. The release should now be imported and appear in the `Asset Browser`, unless files with the same name have already existed in the project, in which case they can be replaced or the import of each such file can be skipped.
6. Confirm that each invidual file was imported successfully.

### Creating a Package and importing it

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the project of the cloned repository in GameMaker Studio 2.
3. In the `Tools` toolbar, open the `Create Local Package` menu.
4. In `Package Details`, fill the `Display name` and `Package ID (Filename)` fields, also select `Add All` in the resource selection. Then select `OK`.
5. Select where the Package file should be saved.
6. Open the project in GameMaker Studio 2 to which the Package is to be included into.
7. In the `Tools` toolbar, open the `Import Local Package` menu.
8. Choose the previously saved Package file and open it.
9. Choose `Add All` and then `Import`. The Package should now be imported and appear in the `Asset Browser`, unless files with the same name have already existed in the project, in which case they can be replaced or the import of each such file can be skipped.
10. Confirm that each invidual file was imported successfully.
